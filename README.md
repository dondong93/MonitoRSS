# MonitoRSS (formerly Discord.RSS)

This is the core repository of the MonitoRSS bot (formerly known as Discord.RSS) for development and programmatic use. For the web interface development and programmatic use, see https://github.com/synzen/MonitoRSS-Web.

For users who want to deploy MonitoRSS for personal use, see https://github.com/synzen/MonitoRSS-Clone.

Driven by the lack of comprehensive RSS bots available, I have decided to try my hand at creating one of my own. Designed with as much customization as possible for both users and bot hosters, while also (or should be) easy to understand.

All documentation can be found at https://docs.monitorss.xyz.

***

Note that this is the `dev` branch. This is a monorepo representing the re-write of the bot TO better handle the growing demands of the publicly hosted version. This work is still in-progress. For the stable version, please switch to the `master` branch.

More documentation is TBD, however some processes will be stored in the diagrams folder while they are being worked on as draw.io files.
